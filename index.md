<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">My name is Joshua Greenslade and I am in my final year at the University of Toronto in the computer science program, specializing in software engineering. I have learned about a variety of topics throughout my university career in several different settings including lecture and individual work, as well as through group work. These topics include how to develop software in Java, JavaScript, C, Python, among others. I have also created and managed databases using SQL and NoSQL. I studied human computer interaction and interface design, as well as web development, computer graphics and computer and network security. I also have experience and am comfortable working with Windows and UNIX systems. In addition, I have had experience doing white box and black box unit testing in Java and Python. In my courses I learned how to work with my team to complete a project well and on time, and to balance multiple projects at a time.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this website, which I have created using the Jekyll and Bootstrap frameworks, I have included pages for some of the major courses I have taken that may be of some interest, where each page will go over a few of the things that I learned in that class. A link to each class will be in the dropdown menu.</p>
