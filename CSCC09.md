<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class I learned how to create web applications using good practices, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of a single page site over a conventional site, which is mainly a trade-off between initial loading time and individual page loading time. I discovered that single page applications lake longer to load initially, especially if there are a lot of videos because you have to load them all right away even if you do not need them, but are very fast when navigating through the site, since the content is already loaded. On the other hand, conventional sites are faster to load, because you are not loading all the content initially, but take longer to navigate through because you have to load the content for the page you want. One of the major points to this class was to teach us how to learn new frameworks by ourselves and determine if it is what we are looking for. Throughout the class I learned how to create web applications using JavaScript and the model view controller design for the client side and using Nodejs for the server side with various npm libraries. I also learned about the various features that were introduced with HTML5 and how to use them. In the class we built our servers using a REST API and a NoSQL database. We also learned how to make Ajax requests to get data from the server without needing to refresh the page. The importance of HTTPS and how to properly secure your page, was also discussed; this included validating and sanitizing input as well as storing passwords using salted hashes, so that, in the event of the app being compromised, the passwords will not be. We also talked about using sessions and third party authentication as well as i18n and l10n and the importance of making your page language agnostic so that it is easy to adapt for multiple languages. We also briefly touched on using templates and web services like SOAP messages. In the class there were assignments and a project where we developed and displayed our understanding of these topics.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the assignments we worked on creating an image gallery app where you can upload and view your galleryâ€™s images as well as other users' galleries. This app in not currently posted online but it can be run locally by downloading the code from <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/CSCC09/tree/master/assignment/3">github</a>.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the project, I worked with one other person to create a fantasy hockey site, where you can pick your own team, trying to pick players that will earn more points than the players on your friends' teams. For this app we used a mongodb database and bootstrap to make it responsive. The code for this page can be found on <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/fantasy-genius">github</a>. For this project we decided to post it online with Heroku at <a href="https://fantasy-genius.herokuapp.com"> https://fantasy-genius.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Throughout this class I furthered my understanding of web applications and the best practices on how to build them. This class helped me to realize that developing web applications is something that I enjoy and may be something that I will want to do in the future.</p>
