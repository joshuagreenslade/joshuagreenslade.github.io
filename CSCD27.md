<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we learned about the different types of vulnerabilities that exist in computer systems, programs, and networks, as well as how the vulnerabilities are exploited by hackers to access, modify or prevent access to information, and/or services.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">We first learned about basic cryptography, how to use cryptographic function, how and when they fail, and how they can be exploited, most of the time by reusing the same key more than once. We also looked at the two types of cryptographic functions; symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography. First off symmetric key cryptography uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt, this is split into two sub categories, stream cipher and block cipher. Stream cyphers are much faster but are less secure, where as block ciphers are slower but more secure, so which one you use depends on the situation. We saw that a one-time pad cypher is the best symmetric key cipher, in theory, because it uses a random key, but it is difficult to secretly transmit the key to be able to decrypt. Asymmetric key cryptography is when there is a key that is public to everyone (used to encrypt) and a private key (used to decrypt) that is unique to each application and is kept secret. This is much more secure than symmetric key cryptography, however it is much slower. Typically, symmetric and asymmetric are used together, asymmetric to transmit the secret key and symmetric to encrypt and decrypt the message. We then saw how attackers try to use the flaws in the implementation of cryptography, to try to break the cryptographic functions, generally by finding someone using the same key twice with symmetric ciphers and then being able to either find the key or parts of the secret message.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">We then looked at how HTTP is not secure by default and how easy it is to sniff HTTP packets to see the traffic on the network to see what the message is. We also saw how easy it is for attacker to prevent packets from reaching their destination, redirecting packets to a new destination or modifying packets to send a different message by taking advantage of insecure network protocols. Next we saw that most of these attacks can be prevented by encrypting the packets by using HTTPS to ensure that it is harder for someone to read, modify, redirect messages, however, this does not stop the ability of an attack to stop messages from reaching their destination, but it does prevent them from being redirected to other sites because the information is encrypted so redirecting them is a waste of time since they cannot be read.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">After that we looked at the server side for possible areas of weakness and found that attackers can gain access by stealing or guessing usersâ€™ passwords to gain access to a system and be able to run malware to be able to gain access to sensitive information, or take down a system, among many other things. We found that it is easy to compromise an existing program when not much thought is put into security when it is being built, how attackers exploit them with various attacks, and how thinking about security when writing software can make it much more difficult for attackers to achieve their goals. Then finally we looked into how attackers can take advantage of poorly designed web applications to steal sensitive information because they were not created with security in mind.</p>

<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Overall we found that it is never possible to achieve 100% security because, as you make something more secure, attackers have found other ways to get it. In the end security is about deciding how far you are willing to go to protect what you have; do you need millions of dollars of security to protect something that is worth $5?</p>
