        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">About</h1>
        
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">My name is Joshua Greenslade and in the fall I will be starting my final year at the University of Toronto in the computer science program, specializing in software engineering. I have learned about a variety of topics throughout my university career in several different settings including lecture and individual work, as well as through group work. These topics include how to develop software in Java, JavaScript, C, Python, among others. I have also created and managed databases using SQL and NoSQL. I studied human computer interaction and interface design, as well as web development. I also have experience and am comfortable working with Windows and UNIX systems. In addition, I have had experience doing white box and black box unit testing in Java and Python. In my courses I learned how to work with my team to complete a project well and on time, and to balance multiple projects at a time.</p>
        
        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this website I have included pages for some of the major courses I have taken that may be of some interest, where each page will go over a few of the things that I learned in that class. A link to each class will be in the dropdown menu.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="software" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Software Design/Engineering</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Throughout all of the software design and engineering classes that I have taken, I have learned how to write modular software using Java, the proper way to design software, as well as how to design software using UML diagrams. We also learned about some of the major design patterns that are used in software, and how to use them. Those classes also involved a lot of group work where we created software in a real life setting, which, in one case, was using a version of the agile development process. One of the most important things that we learned was how to work effectively in a group as well as how to deal with problems that occur in the group during the development process. In the software design and engineering classes we had three major projects.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">The first project that we worked on in a group was creating a basic flight booking android app, where we learned how to develop an app from scratch using the best design principles and practices. Unfortunately, I do not have permission to share the app or the code, but the basic idea was an app that would allow users to book flights. Since this was an introductory course the app was not connected to the internet and only used artificial data.  The main challenge for this project was learning how to work effectively in a group to produce a working product.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">The next project that we worked on in a group was creating a plugin for <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, an open source bibliography management tool. For this project we had a client (another professor at the university) who wanted us to add some additional features, so, using a form of the agile development process, we produced a plugin for the application. Our repository for that project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/CSCC01-project">github</a>. One of the main challenges in this class was learning how to work with a real client to figure out what they really wanted. Another one of the challenges was trying to understand what the existing code Zotero code did in order for us to figure out how to add the additional features to it.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">For the final group project, we worked on contributing to <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib">Matpolotlib</a>, an open source plotting software. Our task was to find some bugs and fix them, unfortunately for the bugs that we fixed, someone else made a pull request so we were not able to have our contribution merged into the codebase. Our repository for the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/CSCD01">github</a>. The main challenge we had was trying to get a general understanding of the huge codebase so that we could fix our bugs and make a contribution. This helped us learn how to be able to figure out how a large piece of software works without reading every line of code.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Overall, after completing these classes and working on these projects, I have learned how to effectively work in a team situation and how to deal with problems if they arise within the team. I have also learned strategies that help to understand large codebases as well as how to write good modular code that allows for easy maintenance and that is easy to understand for other developers who may be using my code, as well for as myself.</p>

      <div id="CSCC09" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Programming on the Web</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class I learned how to create web applications using good practices, as well as the advantages of a single page site over a conventional site, which is why I decided to make this web site a single page site. One of the major points to this class was to teach us how to learn new frameworks by ourselves and determine if it is what we are looking for. Throughout the class I learned how to create web applications using JavaScript and the model view controller design for the client side and using Nodejs for the server side with various npm libraries. I also learned about the various features that were introduced with HTML5 and how to use them. In the class we built our servers using a REST API and a NoSQL database. We also learned how to make Ajax requests to get data from the server without needing to refresh the page. The importance of HTTPS and how to properly secure your page, was also discussed; this included validating and sanitizing input as well as storing passwords using salted hashes, so that, in the event of the app being compromised, the passwords will not be. We also talked about using sessions and third party authentication as well as i18n and l10n and the importance of making your page language agnostic so that it is easy to adapt for multiple languages. We also briefly touched on using templates and web services like SOAP messages. In the class there were assignments and a project where we developed and displayed our understanding of these topics.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the assignments we worked on creating an image gallery app where you can upload and view your galleryâ€™s images as well as other users' galleries. This app in not currently posted online but it can be run locally by downloading the code from <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/CSCC09/tree/master/assignment/3">github</a>.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the project, I worked with one other person to create a fantasy hockey site, where you can pick your own team, trying to pick players that will earn more points than the players on your friends' teams. For this app we used a mongodb database and bootstrap to make it responsive. The code for this page can be found on <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/fantasy-genius">github</a>. For this project we decided to post it online with Heroku at <a href="https://fantasy-genius.herokuapp.com"> https://fantasy-genius.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Throughout this class I furthered my understanding of web applications and the best practices on how to build them. This class helped me to realize that developing web applications is something that I enjoy and may be something that I will want to do in the future.</p>

      <div id="CSCC10" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Human-Computer Interaction</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class I learned how to evaluate the interaction between humans and computers, specifically computer programs. I also learned about the proper design process to go through when creating an application, specifically ways to gather user requirements, designing, prototyping, evaluating, and then redesigning. During the class we talked about low-fidelity prototypes like paper prototypes, and high-fidelity prototypes like prototypes produced by software such as <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> or <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/">JustInMind</a>. We also talked about the different ways to evaluate the interaction between an application and its users and how to use this information to improve an application. Another very important topic that we covered about was making your app accessible by giving the users options to modify the frontend of the application to suit their needs, such as; larger text, larger buttons, a different colour scheme, text to speech, etc.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the class there was a project, where, in groups, we were to create a basic prototype for a new design of an existing app. My group and I decided to upgrade the UTSC Mobile app to make it more appealing and user friendly. The prototype we created can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/C10BravoTeam">github</a>. The prototype shows a design that is more organized and less cluttered, as well as some accessibility options that we thought would be a good idea. It also provides a search bar as well as a collapsible menu. During the process of designing the prototype we conducted a usability study to make sure that we were making improvements that made sense and that the users actually wanted.</p>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the end, this class taught me how to properly design an app and the process that needs to be followed to do it effectively. It also taught me how important it is to make an application accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>

      <div id="CSCC24" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Principles of Programming Languages</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we covered programming languages, mainly the basics of each language, how it is structured, how to use it, as well as how it compares with the other languages we studied. We looked at Java, Python, Scheme, and Haskell, mostly using online documentation to find out how to do something in the language. One of the main challenges was learning Scheme and Haskell because they were functional programming languages and, up to that point, we had only learned object oriented languages, so it was a little difficult to get used to the different style. This class taught me how to use languages that I already know how to use to help me learn a new language by comparing the similarities between languages and using the documentation. I believe this skill will be useful if I am required to use a language that I have never seen before because that was what happened in this class.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="CSCC43" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Introduction to Databases</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we talked about relational algebra, database management and SQL databases. The main topics were how to structure SQL queries to retrieve certain data and how to structure databases in order to have fast and efficient retrieval of data. This class taught me about how to use relational databases and how to use relational algebra to query the data as well as how to use MySQL. This involved when to use certain operations over others, like joins and Cartesian products. In this class my group and I developed an application that used an SQL database, this allowed us to demonstrate what we learned and showed me how important it is to properly structure a database system so it is easy to extract information from it. Unfortunately, I do not have permission to share this application. I believe that, with the knowledge gained from this class, I will be able to use SQL databases, along with NoSQL databases, in other applications that I may be involved with in the future.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="CSCC69" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Operating Systems</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we learned about how operating systems work and the different layers that they have. We also talked about concurrency problems that arise when an operating system uses multithreading and the possible solutions to those problems, mainly locks and Semaphores. We demonstrated our knowledge of these topics and others that we learned in the class in three assignments where we added upgrades to OS161, a basic operating system. Each assignment focused on different parts of an operating system, where we improved on the basic implementation in OS161, the main topics were processes and scheduling, virtual memory, and file systems. The code for each assignment can be found on <a href="https://github.com/joshuagreenslade/CSCC69">github</a>. This class showed us how much work an operating system does in order to improve performance as well as how it hides all of the work it does from the user to make it appear to execute commands instantaneously. In the class we also learned how to efficiently search through an existing codebase to find where to implement our changes. It also helped us to learn more about using pointers and data structures in C. </p>

      <div id="CSCC85" class="page">
        <h1 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Introduction to Embedded Systems</h1>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we learned about the importance of embedded systems and the different types of embeded systems. We also learned about how to uses noisy sensors by trying to eliminate the interference using various techniques including sampling, Kalman filters, among others. In addition, we covered the importance of reliability and how to improve it with redundancy and consensus. In this class we demonstrated our new knowledge in three major assignments; each project required us to create a system that would be able to operate by itself, with no human interference. Unfortunately, I do not have permission to share the code for any of these projects.</p>

        <div class="textVideo col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <p class="col-md-6">The first project was about robot localization. The task was to create a robot that, when placed on a map, would figure out where on the map it was and then move to a specific location on the map. This required a fair bit of thinking about how to build the robot in order to reduce as much noise as possible for the sensor. I have included a video of our robot localizing itself. The robot drives on the black line and when it arrives at a yellow intersection it scans the surrounding squares to determine which intersection it is at, making a different sound for each different colour. It continues doing this until it has determined which intersection it is at, at which point it stops and beeps twice then drives to its final destination.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">The second project was about fault tolerance. We were given a landing simulator and we first created an autopilot that would land the craft. We then created a failsafe so that, in the event that one or two of the engines or sensors failed, the craft would still land successfully. I do not currently have a video of this but I intend to get one in the near future.</p>

        <!--div class="video container-fluid">

          </div>
        </div-->

        <div class="textVideo col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <p class="col-md-6">The final project was about artificial intelligence. The task was to create a robot that would play soccer against other robots. We had to decide in which situations our robot would try to score and when it would try to defend. One of the major difficulties we had was the camera because it was noisy so the robot did not know its exact location, only a general location. We had to get around this in order for the robot to shoot the ball. Our robot also had to deal with the ball and the opponent moving around and had to react accordingly. Unfortunately, I do not have a video of our robot playing against another robot but I do have a video below testing our robot taking a penalty shot.</p>

          <div class="video container-fluid col-md-6">
            <div align="center" class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
              <video id="penalty_shot" preload="auto" controls="true" class="embed-responsive-item">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Overall this class showed me that there is a lot of work that goes into making an embedded system that is fault tolerant and works without human interaction. It also showed me how to deal with problems that may arise when designing these types of systems, and also furthered my experience with programming languages such as C.</p>
