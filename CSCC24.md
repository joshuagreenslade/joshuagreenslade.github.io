<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In this class we covered programming languages, mainly the basics of each language, how it is structured, how to use it, as well as how it compares with the other languages we studied. We looked at Java, Python, Scheme, and Haskell, mostly using online documentation to find out how to do something in the language. One of the main challenges was learning Scheme and Haskell because they were functional programming languages and, up to that point, we had only learned object oriented languages, so it was a little difficult to get used to the different style. This class taught me how to use languages that I already know how to use to help me learn a new language by comparing the similarities between languages and using the documentation. I believe this skill will be useful if I am required to use a language that I have never seen before because that was what happened in this class.</p>
